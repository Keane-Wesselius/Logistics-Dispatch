Sajith focuses on marketing

we have a good understanding 


One issue of the document
	optimization of routes
		

once a product is delivered
	is there analylitics of the completed deliverys

user flow perspective
	supervisor - role has more access than a worker user

mobile all the way?
	no taban wanted desktop applications

Optimization from multiple deliveries
	one routes Point B is near the next Point A

Work orders will change mid route?
	we have not heard of anything like that from taban
