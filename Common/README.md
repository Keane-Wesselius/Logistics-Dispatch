# Winter 2023 CS 481 Logistic Dispatch - Common
This folder contains common and shared code between Mobile, Desktop, and Backend, such as the packet structures and strings.

To edit the Packet source file, edit the '_packets_source.js' file, then execute the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will copy the rolled-up 'packet.js' file to Mobile and Desktop, where they can be used and packaged into their respective builds.
