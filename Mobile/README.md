# Winter 2023 CS 481 Logistic Dispatch - Mobile
This folder contains the code which is required for the Mobile to function, which handles driver interactions with the Backend by accepting jobs and updating the status of them.

To execute the Mobile client, execute the following commands:
```
npm install
npx expo start
```

<!-- TODO: Add note about ports and ip addresses, what the mobile is actually doing, etc. -->
