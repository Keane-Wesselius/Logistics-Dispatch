ListOrders (will validate on the backend what type of account the user is, should only return orders visible to the user)

Get UserData (will return User database data for that speicifc user)

Choose One:
	UpdateStatus (will update the status of an order from order_id, need to validate if the user can update that status of that order. For instance, drivers would update the status of an order to 'accepted')
		Simpler, requires more code to check context of actions

	TakeJob, RejectOrder, Cancel an Order, Purchase an Item For Sale, etc (will update the status of an order from order_id to 'accepted'. Need to validate if job isn't taken, etc.)
		Would be better, but more verbose / requires more packet definitions

AddItem (check if user is Supplier and that passed data is valid, modify database)
ListItems (will validate on the backend what type of account the user is, should only return orders visible to the user)

RemoveItem (check if user is Supplier and that passed data is valid, modify database)
	Could simplify further by having a 'status' field in database Item, would use UpdateStatus instead
