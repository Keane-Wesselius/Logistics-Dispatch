Order
	
	Made by the database //order_id// actually called _id (ObjectId)
	merchantId (ObjectId)
	supplierId (ObjectId)
	status (string enum)
	items (array of Object)
	startingAddress (string)
	endingAddress (string)
	totalCost (double)
	purchaseDate (date)
	estimatedDeliveryDate (date)
	minimumDeliveryPrice (double)

		completedDate (date)

{order_id: '1940192401', merchant_id: '28491488941', ..., maximum_delivery_price: 1200}

maximumDeliveryPrice must be at least 8% higher than minimum_delivery_price




Desktop Client Perspective
	Merchant places an order, asked minimum price for shipping
	Then, system computers maximum price from the required minimum offset of 8% and asks user if this is good
	Have a note which says that bad delivery prices may result in products not being delivered ever.
