compared to sql mongodb has a faster startup time to deployment

Mongodb has looser restrictions on data as it as such it is a schema-less
database, as we are working on with limited time and have little experience
with creating a database we can implement a database and if it does not
fit our needs we can modify it as we go without starting over. Once we
have the structure locked in we can force a schema on the database to 
require certain fields while still allowing some flexibility

mariadb is a fork of sql and is rigid although mariadb would be a better
choice over mysql because of its increased performance
mariadb does not have native mobile features

In short mongoDB is more flexible with the data and its structure that
is better suited for an agile development life cycle. mongodb offers free
cloud solutions where are mariadb does not have a free tier. In addition to
being the better choice for this project mongodb is in high demand right
now and would look good on a resume.
