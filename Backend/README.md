# Winter 2023 CS 481 Logistic Dispatch - Backend
This folder contains the code which is required for the Backend to function, which facilitates database access and communication to the Mobile and Desktop clients.

To execute the backend server, execute the following commands:
```
npm run start
```

Then, either the Mobile or Desktop clients can connect to the server.

<!-- TODO: Add note about ports and ip addresses, what the backend is actually doing, etc. -->
